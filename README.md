- How to add more documents:
   - Put the pdf version of the document in the documents folder
   - Open up terminal and type 'python embed_doc.py"
   - Make some kind of change in backend_logic.py (like add a space somewhere, so the file is picked up by Github and Streamlit Cloud can reload the file for it to connect to the new database with new documents)
   - Push changes using Github Desktop and Streamlit Cloud should be able to pick up those changes
